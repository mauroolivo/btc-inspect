# Bitcoin Transaction Inspector (Discontinued)

This project began as an experiment, building upon the code from [programming-bitcoin](https://github.com/mauroolivo/programming-bitcoin). Its main goal was to provide a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for inspecting Bitcoin transactions, using data sourced from the Blockstream.info API.

## Project Status

**This project is now discontinued and will no longer be maintained.**

After initial development, I realized that similar functionality could be achieved by querying my own Bitcoin node directly. As a result, I started a new and improved project: [btc-node](https://github.com/mauroolivo/btc-node). All future development and enhancements will continue there.

## Legacy Information

- Original data source: Blockstream.info API
- Purpose: GUI for Bitcoin transaction inspection
- Successor project: [btc-node](https://github.com/mauroolivo/btc-node)

Thank you for your interest. Please refer to the new repository for ongoing work and improvements.
